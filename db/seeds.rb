Funding agencies and/or data repositories may have end-user license requirements in place; if not, they may still be able to guide you in the development of a license. Once created, please consider including a copy of your end-user license with your Data Management Plan.  Note that only the intellectual property rights holder(s) can issue a license, so it is crucial to clarify who owns those rights. </p><p>There are several types of standard licenses available to researchers, such as the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/choose/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons licenses</a> and the <a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Data Commons licenses</a>. In fact, for most datasets it is easier to use a standard license rather than to devise a custom-made one. Note that even if you choose to make your data part of the public domain, it is preferable to make this explicit by using a license such as Creative Commons'  CC0. </p> <p>Read more about data licensing: <a href=\"http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data\" target=\"_blank\">UK Digital Curation Centre</a>. </p>"
